# ENERGY_STORAGE

An application that will optimize energy consumption

-> an attempt to create the most optimal solution for charging and discharging energy from energy storage in order to minimize the deviation of power demand in one day

-> diagram display (as straight a line as possible)

-> in DB: power capacity and power

-> from client side: display of consumption for a specific day
